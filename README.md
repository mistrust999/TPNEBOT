# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: May 31, 2025*

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **\TPNEBOT** (“the Bot,” “we,” or “us”) collects, uses, stores, and deletes personal data when you interact with our Discord bot. By using the Bot, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Data We Collect

* **User Identifiers**
  We store your Discord user ID (a unique numeric identifier) to tie database records to individual users.
* **User-Generated Data**
  Depending on command usage, we may persist:

  * Economy data (wallet ID, bank balance, transaction history)
  * Punishment history (bans, kicks, mutes)
  * Command preferences or settings (e.g., custom prefixes, opt-in flags)
* **Temporary In-Memory Data**
  Some features (e.g., the `snipe` command that shows recently deleted messages) rely on data kept in RAM only. That data is automatically purged every hour and is not written to disk.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

* **Core Functionality**
  We need user IDs and economy records to track balances, process bets, and enforce limits.
* **Moderation & Punishment**
  Punishment history (warnings, bans, mutes) is stored so that staff can enforce rules consistently. This data is retained even if you later “forget” your profile.
* **“Forget Me” Requests**
  Users can invoke the `forgetme` command to delete all stored personal data. Upon correct PIN confirmation, we remove:

  * All personal records in the database (wallets, settings, preferences)
  * All historical transaction logs tied to your user ID (except punishment actions)
    **Note:** Punishment history (bans/mutes/kicks) is kept indefinitely for audit and moderation purposes, even after a “forget me” request.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

* **Automatic Deletions**

  * In-memory caches (e.g., deleted-message logs for `snipe`) are cleared hourly.
* **User-Initiated Deletions**

  * Using `forgetme` erases nearly all stored data (economy records, settings, preferences) after PIN confirmation.
  * Punishment history is an exception and remains in our records for moderation accountability.
* **Retention Period**
  If you never run `forgetme`, your data remains in our database until you request deletion or the bot is retired.

## 5. Data Security

* We use industry-standard encryption and hashing for sensitive data (for example, we never store raw passwords).
* Access to our production database is restricted only to authorized bot processes.
* We regularly audit permissions and perform backups to ensure data integrity.

## 6. Third-Party Access

* We do not sell, lease, or share your personal data with third parties outside of assistive services (e.g., Discord’s API).
* We do not integrate analytics or advertising trackers in the Bot. Commands that display data (like `snipe`) only keep ephemeral information in memory.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

* The Bot is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13. If we become aware of any data collected from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it immediately.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our data practices. When we do, we will post the updated policy here and update the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.

## 9. Contact

If you have questions or concerns about this policy, or want to request data deletion beyond what `forgetme` supports (for example, you want punishment history removed), please contact a bot administrator via Discord DM or email at: support@\[yourdomain].com.

# Terms of Service

*Last updated: May 31, 2025*

## 1. Eligibility

* You must be at least 13 years old to use the Bot.
* By using the Bot, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.

## 2. Acceptable Use

* **Lawful Behavior**
  You agree not to use the Bot for any illegal or abusive purpose. Any form of harassment, hate speech, spamming, or other malicious behavior is strictly prohibited.
* **No Abuse of Economy or Gambling Systems**
  The Bot features economy and gambling commands (like `blackjack`). You must not try to exploit bugs, use multiple accounts to manipulate balances, or circumvent built-in limits. Staff reserves the right to freeze or ban accounts suspected of abuse.
* **Respect Privacy**
  The Bot offers moderation tools (e.g., `snipe`) that temporarily store deleted message content. Do not misuse this functionality to invade others’ privacy. All in-memory caches are cleared hourly; do not attempt to preserve or share that data.

## 3. Account Data & Security

* **User Responsibility**
  You are responsible for keeping your Discord account secure. If your account is compromised, you are still liable for any actions taken by unauthorized parties until you notify a server moderator or bot administrator.
* **Resetting or Deleting Data**
  You may delete all your personal data (except punishment history) by using the `forgetme` command. Deletion is irreversible, and once you confirm the 4-digit PIN, your records (wallet balance, settings, preferences) will be permanently erased.

## 4. Punishment & Moderation

* Rule infractions may result in warnings, temporary mutes, kicks, or bans. Punishment history is retained even after a “forgetme” request to ensure consistent moderation.
* Repeated or severe violations can lead to permanent blacklisting. Blacklisted users cannot use any Bot command until unblacklisted by staff.

## 5. Intellectual Property

* All code, design, and content of the Bot are owned by the developer. You may not reproduce or redistribute any portion of the Bot without express written permission.
* Any commands you submit (e.g., custom quotes or images) remain your intellectual property, but by using the Bot, you grant us a non-exclusive license to store and display them as part of Bot functionality.

## 6. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability

* **“As-Is” Basis**
  The Bot is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind (express or implied). We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.
* **Financial Disclaimer**
  Economy commands, virtual currency, and gambling features are for entertainment. No real-world money is involved, and we do not assume liability for any losses (virtual or otherwise).
* **Limitation of Liability**
  Under no circumstances shall the Bot developers be liable for any incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of the Bot.

## 7. Changes to the Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated Terms here and update the “Last updated” date. Your continued use of the Bot after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

## 8. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or permanently ban your access to the Bot at our sole discretion—particularly for serious violations like persistent abuse, spamming, or hacking attempts. Termination does not erase your existing data unless you’ve used `forgetme`. Punishment history remains on file.

## 9. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Bot owner’s jurisdiction (e.g., Ontario, Canada), without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the appropriate courts of that jurisdiction.

## 10. Contact

If you have questions about these Terms, please reach out via Discord DM to a bot administrator.
